<p><b>Cubic Music</b> is an evolving streaming app focused on smooth music playback and user experience.  
- While it might not be as polished as some mature apps yet, it's a solid, good-looking, and lightweight alternative.  
- The project is maintained and will only be updated when I fix bugs or add features as I learn Kotlin skills!</p>

**⭐ STAR AND FOLLOW 😅 NOW!!! The way to go**
