Fixed:
- Song restart when start new radio
- Duplicate song titles & artists in "next in queue"
- Play song from search didn't do anything while playing another song
- Crash when rearrage song positions in playlist

Changed:
- Hide menu after "Start radio"
- Improve next song(s) in queue
- "Add to playlist" will not close after selection
- Migrate to material3 (expect subtle changes in UI/UX)
